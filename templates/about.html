                    Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone, or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.
                    OR 
                    Phishing is a cyber attack where the attacker tricks the target into disclosing personal information, revealing login credentials, or transferring money.

                      The purpose of phishing is to collect sensitive information with the intention of using that information to gain access to otherwise protected data, networks, etc. A phisher's success is contingent upon establishing trust with its victims. <br><br>

                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> <b> Deceptive Phishing:</b> Deceptive phishing is by far the most common type of phishing scam. In this ploy, fraudsters impersonate a legitimate company to steal people’s personal data or login credentials. Those emails frequently use threats and a sense of urgency to scare users into doing what the attackers want. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> <b>Spear Phishing:</b> Spear Phishing targets specific individuals instead of a wide group of people. Attackers often research their victims on social media and other sites. That way, they can customize their communications and appear more authentic. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> <b>Other phishing Technique</b> <i class='bx bxs-hand-down'></i><br><br>
                      <i class='bx bx-right-arrow-alt icon-arrrow'></i> <b>Angler Phishing:</b> This cyberattack comes by way of social media. It may involve fake URLs, instant messages or profiles used to obtain sensitive data. Attackers also peruse social profiles to glean any personal information they can use for social engineering. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bx-right-arrow-alt icon-arrrow'></i> <b>Clone Phishing:</b> Clone phishing involves exact duplication of an email to make it appear as legitimate as possible.<br><br>
                      <i class='bx bx-right-arrow-alt icon-arrrow'></i> <b>Domain Spoofing:</b> In this category of phishing, the attacker forges a company domain, which makes the email appear to be from that company.<br><br>
                      <i class='bx bx-right-arrow-alt icon-arrrow'></i> <b>Email Phishing:</b> Phishing emails are often the first to come to mind when people hear the term phishing. Attackers send an illegitimate email asking for personal information or login credentials.<br><br>
                      <i class='bx bx-right-arrow-alt icon-arrrow'></i> <b>Search Engine Phishing:</b> Rather than sending correspondence to you to gain information, search engine fishing involves creating a website that mimics a legitimate site. Site visitors are asked to download products that are infected with malware or provide personal information in forms that go to the attacker.<br><br>
                      <i class='bx bx-right-arrow-alt icon-arrrow'></i> <b>Smishing:</b> Combine SMS with phishing and you have the technique called smishing. With smishing, attackers send fraudulent text messages in an attempt to gather information like credit card numbers or passwords.<br><br>
                      <i class='bx bx-right-arrow-alt icon-arrrow'></i> <b>Whaling:</b> A whaling attack targets the big fish, or executive-level employees. An attack of this sort often involves more sophisticated social engineering tactics and intelligence gathering to better sell the fake.<br><br>
                      <i class='bx bx-right-arrow-alt icon-arrrow'></i> <b>Vishing:</b> Combine VoIP with phishing and you get vishing. This type of phishing involves calls from a fraudulent person attempting to obtain sensitive information.<br><br>

                  <p>
                      To help prevent phishing attacks, you should observe general best practices, similar to those you might undertake to avoid viruses and other malware. First, make sure your systems are updated to help protect against known vulnerabilities. Protect devices and systems with reputable security software and firewall protection. You can also add software that watches for PII being sent over email or other insecure methods.Since the weak link in phishing attacks is the end user, you should provide proper end-user security awareness training and educate your team on how to recognize a phishing scam. The key to protecting against phishing lies in the ability to recognize the cyberattack as illegitimate. Following are some key concepts to include in end-user training: <br><br>

                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Users are to choose strong passwords and be wary of posting your personal details on social media. Information like birthdates, addresses and phone numbers are valuable to an attacker. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> If there are any suspicions about an email or social post, contact the IT team to have them examine the situation. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Only open attachments from a trusted source. When in doubt, check with the alleged sender directly. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Note any language differences in messaging or emails that vary from legitimate organizational communications. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Never give away personal information in an email or unsolicited call. For instance, financial institutions will never call and ask for login credentials or account info because they already have it. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Inspect emails for typos and inaccurate grammar. This is usually a dead giveaway of less-sophisticated phishing scams. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Don’t supply personal information via email or text. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Beware of urgent or time-sensitive warnings. Phishing attacks often prompt action by pretending to be urgent. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Verify emails and other correspondence by contacting the organization directly. If you think something is fishy (okay, bad pun), a phone call can quickly identify a legitimate call from a fake one. <br><br>

                      Since we can’t control the criminals, let’s take a look at how you can prevent phishing attacks. <br>

                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> <b>Train Your Employees</b> - Unsuspecting employees who are not trained to identify phishing emails are easily tricked. If they click on a link, open an attachment, or respond to the email, they could be giving the attacker exactly what they need to break into your system. Training is by far the most crucial action you can take to avoid phishing attacks. By investing in your employees’ security education, you empower them to take ownership of security best practices. With training, your employees can identify a phishing email and report suspicious activity before any information is compromised. <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> <b>Update Your Antivirus Software</b>- Keeping your antivirus software updated adds a layer of security. The software will scan files coming into your computer, preventing possible damage. Ensure that your anti-spyware and firewall settings are active.  <br><br>
                      <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> <b>Stay Up-to-Date</b> - By staying in-the-know, you remain vigilant to phishing attempts. Research common phishing scams so that you’re aware of what security professionals see as the main threats. The more aware you are of what’s out there, the more likely you are to identify a possible attack.  <br><br>

                      One of the Biggest Data Breaches from Phishing: <br><br> John Podesta’s Email
                      There was a lot of controversy surrounding the November 2016 election on both sides of the political spectrum. One of the most notable was the hack of John Podesta’s Gmail account. Podesta, chairman of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s democratic election campaign, found himself as one of the country’s top phishing attack examples when his account was victimized by a Russian hacker group known as Fancy Bear. The phishers, pretending to be Google, sent an email saying that he needed to change his email after an attempted hack occurred. However, in true phishing attack fashion, the email linked to a malicious website. When someone with access to Podesta’s email used the compromised link, the hackers gained access to his account. This led to the eventual release of thousands of Podesta’s emails via WikiLeaks in the weeks leading up to the November election.

                        One of the Biggest Data Breaches from Phishing: <br><br> BenefitMall
                        Among the most recent phishing attacks reported by the media is one that affected BenefitMall, a human resource, employee benefits, and payroll administration solutions company. Between June 2018 and October 2018, the company’s website was accessed via employee email login credentials that were exposed during an email phishing attack, according to a press release. The types of consumer information left exposed in the affected mailboxes are thought to include:
                       <br> <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Names <br><br>
                        <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Email addresses <br><br>
                        <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Birth dates <br><br>
                        <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Bank account information <br><br>
                        <i class='bx bxs-chevron-right-circle icon-circle'></i> Insurance premium payment information <br><br>
                        Although the full extent of the attack is not yet known, BenefitMall works with “a network of more than 20,000 Trusted Advisors” to serve more than “200,000 small and medium-sized businesses.” This leaves a potentially enormous group of employees and businesses at risk.

                        One of the Biggest Data Breaches from Phishing: <br><br> Sony Pictures
                        In retaliation for the creation of the movie “The Interview,” a film about the plot to kill North Korea’s head of state, a North Korean government-backed hacker group launched a devastating attack on the entertainment giant in November 2014. Using phishing and spear-phishing emails, which contained malware, the attackers gained access to Sony’s network and performed months of covert reconnaissance.
                        
                        Once inside, they also threatened company employees and executives, stole confidential data, and disabled thousands of the company’s computers. The attack is thought to have cost the company upwards of $100 million.

                        In August of 2019, investigators confirmed Methodist Hospitals’ worst fear. A phishing attack compromised more than 68,000 patients’ information. The hospital did not discover the breach until June when an employee reported suspicious activity in their email account. The investigation revealed that at least two email accounts had been compromised.
                        
                        The data obtained from each affected patient varied but included the following: names, addresses, health insurance information, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, bank account numbers, electronic signatures, login credentials, dates of birth, treatment information, and insurance information.
